# Development

## Ruby

The Ruby portion is developed with VSCode. Some of the nice-to-have VSCode
extensions are:

- EditorConfig
- Prettier: applies to JavaScript
- Ruby
- Ruby Solargraph
- ruby-rubocop
- VSCode Ruby

Including SketchUp and Ruby code analysis:

- Ensure to have Ruby 2.7+ installed.
- Run `bundle install` from the root directory of this project (via terminal).
- Run `bundle update` when VSCode notifies about outdated gems.
