// Ruby build places the actual config.h into a platform-specific directory but
// expects to find it under ruby. Apparently the assumption is that the
// platform-specific directory will be added to C++ include paths of every
// project that uses Ruby. This is inconvenient and I chose to create this
// wrapper that simply includes the platform-specific config header.
